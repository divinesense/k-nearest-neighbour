This is the same program as knn.py ie it implements KNN algorithm for classification , but the
difference is that this program will calculate and display the accuracy for a value of k

Again to run this program , open terminal and type in "python knnv2.py" , make sure flower.csv file is present in the current working directory.

Here, as well as in the knn.py program fower.csv contains the dataset which is divided into two datasets namely
training dataset (67%) and test dataset (33%).
