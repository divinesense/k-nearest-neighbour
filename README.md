# k-nearest-neighbour
A machine learning algorithm for classification problems.
*****************************************************************************************************
* This is my implementation of KNN algorithm in python.                                             *
*                                                                                                   *
* To run the code, download the knn.py file along with the flower.csv file which holds the dataset. *
*                                                                                                   *
* 1) Open terminal                                                                                  *
* 2) type "python knn.py" without quotes and make sure flower.csv file is in current working        * 
*    directory                                                                                      *
* 3) All done!! Enjoy!!                                                                             *
*                                                                                                   *

ADDITIONAL INFO
* this implementation uses eucledian distance to calculate nearest neighbours.
  link---> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance
* It also uses bubblesort to sort the distances.
*To test for different test instances, change the index of test[] to any value between 0-47
